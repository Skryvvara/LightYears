## How to build

1. In the root directory of this project run make

```sh
make
```
This should create a new directory called `build` with everything you need to build the project.

2. cd into `build``

3. run `make all`

4. run the executable
```sh
# for mac/linux:
./LightYearsGame/LightYearsGame
```
